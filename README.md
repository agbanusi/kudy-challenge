## Edge Cases
- Negative Lengths
- Fractional Lengths
- Decimals
- Length in words
- So many shapes not accounted for

## Properties
- Shape generation for circle, rectangle, triagnle, pentagon to decagon
- multiple shapes generation but one submission per one
- color selection of shapes
- animation of shapes
- Storage of data in broser memory, so after reload data still remains
